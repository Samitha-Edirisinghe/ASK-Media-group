                                <h6 style="color: #000;"><b>Personal information provided by you:</b></h6>
                                <p>When you use our services or otherwise interact with us, for example via our social media platforms or through market research, we may ask you to provide information relevant to the circumstances. This information could include your email address, which we require to enable you to subscribe to receive news about our brands, or your contact details and payment information if you purchase something from us. It should be obvious why we are asking for particular information and if it is not we will provide an explanation.  In the next section, we explain in more detail the types of information we might collect.
                                </p>

                                <h6 style="color: #000;"><b>When you share your comments and content with us (User Generated Content)</b></h6>
                                <p>We may sometimes invite you to comment or to share your photos and videos with us.  If you take part then we may publish or use your content on our services or other platforms. There may also be times when you proactively choose to post content on our social media pages or elsewhere that relates to our brands (i.e. simply to show your love for our brands).  When you do this, we may contact you (via the relevant platform) to ask if we can publish or use your content on our services or other platforms.
                                </p>
                                <p>Before we can accept or use your content, you must ensure you have the consent of anyone else featured. We may ask you to provide your email address to verify your age and that you are the legal parent or guardian of any children who may be featured in the content, as may be applicable under section 8 of this Privacy Policy (“Children Using Our Services”).
                                </p>

                                <h6 style="color: #000;"><b>Information collected automatically during your use of our services:</b></h6>
                                <p>When you use or receive services from us over the internet, we automatically record information about your use of those services, your interaction with our adverts and our emails as well as information about the device you are using and your internet connection. We do this in two ways:
                                </p>
                                <p>Log data: When you use our services, certain information gets recorded in our log files such as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) Address, its unique ID, its operating system and location, and your browser type, the pages you viewed, cookie information and referral links (the link that sent you to a particular page).
                                </p>
                                <p>Web technologies: In conjunction with our log data we may use specialist web technologies such as pixels or tags embedded in our web pages and emails and small data files which we store on your device (known as "cookies"). These technologies enable us to recognise your device and to track your interaction with our services, emails and adverts. We do not use these technologies to personally identify you, although we may add some data collected via these technologies to marketing records we hold about you.
                                </p>

                                <h6 style="color: #000;"><b>Information collected via specialist companies:</b></h6>
                                <p>We sometimes use specialist companies to provide us with information they hold in relation to you or to collect information on our behalf.  For example, we use market research agencies to provide us with consumer insights to help shape our programmes, products and services.  Generally speaking, this will be anonymous or aggregated data that means we are unable to identify you specifically.  If personal information is shared with us then we will always ensure this is done lawfully and, where appropriate, with your consent.
                                </p>
                                <p>We might also use the services of social media platforms, advertising agencies or data brokers to enable us to reach certain audiences and to better target our marketing messages or the advertising shown on some of our services.  For example, we might use anonymous information about your browsing on our services or elsewhere to infer your interests and to put you into appropriate "market segments". This information is not used to identify you as a person and we do not attempt to combine it with personal information that we may hold. See the specific cookies notice for the service you are using for more information.

We maintain appropriate organisational and technological safeguards to help protect against loss, misuse or unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information we hold about you. We also seek to ensure our service providers do the same. Unfortunately, no system can be guaranteed as completely secure and there is an inherent risk in transmitting information over the internet.

                                </p>
                                <p>Communication Preferences: If you wish to stop receiving marketing communications from us, please click on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the relevant email. This will not necessarily unsubscribe you from all communications, only the brand/service in question.  If you wish to opt-out completely then please contact us using the details provided below. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from some service-related messages (which are not used to send marketing materials).   
                                </p>
                                <p>In accordance with industry standards, we reserve the right to retain a minimal amount of data necessary to ensure we do not contact you in the future – for example by adding your email address to a ‘suppression list’.

                                <p>Opt-out from personalised advertising cookies and other tracking: If you wish to opt-out of personalised advertising or other forms of "tracking" please refer to the cookies notice for the service you are using (you can find the link in the website footer). Be aware that opting out of personalised advertising will not prevent adverts from being displayed to you but they will no longer be tailored to your interests or browsing behaviour.   
                                </p>
                                <p>Correct your information: You can have any incomplete or inaccurate personal information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

                                <p>Delete your information: In some circumstances you can ask us to delete information we hold about you.  For example, when we no longer need it because you initially gave us consent and you wish to withdraw it. Sometimes we may not be able to delete your information because (i) we are legally required to keep it; or (ii) we need it for our own legitimate business purposes, for example if you were to unsubscribe from an email list, we would need your email address to add to a suppression list to ensure you were not contacted. We will only refuse to delete information where permitted by law. Where applicable, we will explain the reasons for refusing your request.
